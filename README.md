# find

The find application allows you to identify the number of occurrences of a set of strings within a group of files. To determine the number of occurrences (and their position) the Knuth-Morris and Pratt algorithm is used. At each execution, the application will output the list of files analyzed with the occurrences of the string in the text together with information regarding its position. The same information produced in output can be saved on an external file.
